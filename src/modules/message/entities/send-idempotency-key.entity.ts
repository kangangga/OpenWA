 * The lifecycle of one `Idempotency-Key` claim on a send route:
 *  - 'pending'   - the request holding the key is running (or the node died while it ran).
 *  - 'completed' - the send succeeded; `responseBody` is replayed to every retry with the same key.
 *  - 'failed'    - the send failed in a way that does not say whether WhatsApp got the message (an
 *                  engine error or timeout). The key stays taken so a retry cannot send it twice.
 * A refusal before the engine call deletes the row, so the client may retry with the same key.
 * Engine-stage failures keep it taken regardless of HTTP status, including a disconnected socket's 409.

 * One `Idempotency-Key` a client sent on a send route, kept for SEND_IDEMPOTENCY_TTL (24 h) so a
 * retry after a timeout or a dropped connection replays the first answer instead of sending the
 * message again. Opt-in per request: a send without the header never touches this table.
 *
 * UNIQUE(sessionId, idempotencyKey) is the claim: the insert that wins it runs the send, every other
 * request with the pair reads the row. It holds across nodes sharing one database, because the claim
 * is the insert itself rather than a read followed by a write.
 *
 * Lives on the `data` connection (auto-loaded by the message entity glob). Not exported by
 * `GET /infra/export-data`: a key outlives its purpose within a day.
