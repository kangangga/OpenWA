/**
 * A durable record of a webhook delivery that exhausted all of its retries. The queued path (BullMQ)
 * otherwise only leaves a `failed` job that the queue evicts after a day, and the direct fallback path
 * swallowed the final error entirely — so a receiver outage longer than the retry window silently lost
 * events with no operator-visible trail. Each lost delivery is appended here once (see
 * `recordWebhookDeliveryFailure`, which skips a delivery it has already recorded so a replayed one is
 * not reported several times) and surfaced via the ADMIN `GET /webhooks/delivery-failures` endpoint.
 *
 * Lives on the `data` connection (auto-loaded by the webhook entity glob).
